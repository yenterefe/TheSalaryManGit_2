**Salary Man**

A Unity 3D top-down obstacle-avoidance game built during my early days of learning game development.


**About the Project**

Salary Man is a 3D top-down game where players guide an overworked office employee through a maze of workplace obstacles—from stress and distractions to time traps—all in a race to clock out.

This was one of my first Unity projects. I created it to learn the fundamentals of game development and to go through the entire pipeline from concept to publication. The ultimate goal was to publish it on both Itch.io and the Google Play Store.


**Project Goals**

Learn Unity and C# fundamentals


**Build a complete 3D top-down prototype**

Understand Unity’s build process for mobile and web platforms

Gain firsthand experience publishing a game to Itch.io and the Play Store


**What I Learned**

Unity’s classic Input system

Top-down character movement and camera setup

Collision detection and obstacle mechanics

Basic animation and UI setup

Exporting builds for Android and WebGL


**Known Limitations (Early Dev Phase)**

Gameplay logic was separated into a single script: no separation of responsibilities (e.g., input, movement, animation)

Git commits lacked clear messages or structure

Did not use Unity’s newer Input System

Minimal polish on UI, animations, and level design

Basic enemy/obstacle logic


**Future Improvements (If Revisited)**

Refactor codebase into modular, maintainable scripts

Adopt Unity’s new Input System for better control and flexibility

Use consistent, meaningful Git commit messages

Add polish: audio, UI feedback, smoother animations

Improve level design with pacing, variety, and reward mechanics

Optimize performance for mobile devices


**Final Notes**

This project isn’t actively maintained, but it represents a major milestone in my journey as a developer. I’m keeping it public to show how I started—and how much I’ve grown since then.
